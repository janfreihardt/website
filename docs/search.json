    "text": "I am an explorative mind. I like to explore new cultures, explore nature, explore the boundaries of our collective wisdom and last, but not least, explore myself. I am keen to explore the interfaces between scientific evidence, technological progress and societal welfare. After graduating from Environmental Engineering, I therefore did a second master’s in “Science, Technology and Policy” to complement my technological background with an understanding of the inner workings of our society. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Political Science about environmental migration at ETH.\nRecently, I have published a book on transformative science (a way of doing science that is guided by societal problems and co-creates possible solutions for a liveable future): “Draussen ist es anders”.\nAfter my studies, I would like to contribute to the transformation of our society into one that respects the natural boundaries of our planet, so that future generations have the same possibilities like me to explore our world and the beauty of the Earth."

    "text": "Climate change is expected to induce mass-population dislocations, i.e., migration, due to droughts, sea level rise, or extreme weather events, such as stronger and more frequent storms or floods, particularly in developing countries with low capacity to protect themselves and adapt to climate change (Black et al. 2011). However, recent studies on climate change induced human displacement do not account for the possibility that people might adapt to changing climatic conditions (Laurice Jamero et al. 2017) . This is particularly relevant to slow-onset environmental changes, such as sea-level rise, where individuals and societies can anticipate such changes and take precautionary measures. Therefore, it is important to consider people's perceptions of environmental changes (Koubi, Stoll, and Spilker 2016). With this project, we aim at contributing to a better understanding of whether, when, and how environmental changes lead to human migration."
